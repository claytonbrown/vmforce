Force.com SDK for Java
======================

This project is highly experimental at this point and not for the faint of heart. The project currently only contains sample Force.com Java applications that uses a early build of the SDK published to a temporary maven repository. Going forward, this project will be the home for the SDK code itself.

If you decide to try out the samples or build something yourself, you can use the issue tracker to let us know about problems.

What can you do with the SDK?
-----------------------------

The SDK builds upon the Force.com Web Service Connector toolkit that has been available for some time. You can use this SDK to build Spring Web applications that uses Force.com as a data store and user management system.

At this point, all code in the SDK is experimental and incomplete. It is published here for the purpose of testing how the project should be hosted and managed going forward and to give access to those brave souls who want to experiment at this early stage.
